# Staph aureus Lipidomics Resources

Staph aureus Lipidomics Resources is a repository consisting of resources developed or used by the Hines Lab at UGA for bacterial lipidomics. 

## Bacteria LipidPioneer

The excel file ([BacteriaLipidPioneer](https://github.com/HinesLab/Staph-aureus-Lipidomics-Resources/blob/main/BacteriaLipidPioneer_HinesLabVersion.xlsm)) contains an edited version of LipidPioneer ([LipidPioneer](https://secim.ufl.edu/secim-tools/lipidpioneer)) 
which focuses on lipid species most commonly found in *Staphylococcus aureus*. 

## Staph Lipids SDF

The structure data file database ([StaphLipidsSDF](https://github.com/HinesLab/Staph-aureus-Lipidomics-Resources/blob/main/HinesLab_StaphLipids.sdf)) contains bacterial lipids not found in already existing repositories. 
The SDFs were created by modifying the LipidMaps SDF generator to include the LysylPG class as well as PGs, DGDGs, and CLs with saturated odd-carbon acyl tails.
